## Assignment
1. Understand Company Needs
Assess Future Requirements: Identify the current and future growth plans, especially for the new Liverpool office.
Gather Stakeholder Insights: Talk to stakeholders across departments to understand specific infrastructure needs for each area (e.g., performance, data handling, storage, security).

2. Evaluate Current IT Setup 
Review Existing Systems: Examine the current hardware, network, software, and security measures at the London site.
Identify Gaps: Note areas that need upgrades or additional support for scaling, especially considering high availability, security, and connectivity between sites.

3. Design the Infrastructure 
Components to Include:
Networking: Outline the type of network (LAN/WAN, VPN for secure connections) and equipment (routers, switches) required.
Security: Specify necessary security measures (firewalls, encryption, access controls) for secure data handling.
Hardware: Determine server requirements, storage needs, and employee workstations.
Software: Identify software solutions for productivity, security, and collaboration.
Goals: Ensure the design is scalable, reliable, and cost-effective.

4. Connect Multiple Sites 
Build Inter-Office Network: Plan a network to connect the Liverpool office securely with the London data center.
Data Transmission: Ensure fast and reliable data transmission between sites to meet high availability and performance standards.

5. Future-Proof the Design 
Plan for Growth: Design an infrastructure that can easily expand to accommodate a larger workforce, more data, or new office locations.
Consider Cloud Solutions: Explore cloud services for scalability, storage, and disaster recovery options.

6. Add Security and Compliance 
Security Protocols: Implement encryption, firewalls, and secure authentication methods for data protection.
Compliance: Ensure the infrastructure aligns with industry regulations, especially for handling sensitive medical data.

7. Use Cisco Packet Tracer 
Network Simulation: Create network diagrams using Cisco Packet Tracer to model the infrastructure.
Testing Performance: Test network performance and security in the simulation.

8. Project Management 
Plan Deployment: Create a timeline for infrastructure setup, resource allocation, and task delegation for smooth deployment.

9. Testing 
Evaluate Efficiency: Test the network’s efficiency and robustness in the simulated environment.
Optimize: Adjust the setup based on test results to ensure optimal performance.

### Deliverables
* [ ] Network Design Diagrams

* [ ] System Analysis

* [ ] Testing Results

* [ ] Deployment Plan

- **Network Design Diagrams**: Detailed diagrams from Cisco Packet Tracer. 
- **System Analysis**: Document the current setup and propose improvements. 
- **Testing Results**: Summarize the performance tests and any necessary optimizations.

## Task 2

* [ ] Analyse Cloud Costs

* [ ] Plan for Mobility and Remote Access

* [ ] Evaluate Current Cloud Skills

* [ ] Ensure Scalability and Security

* [ ] Cloud Storage and Backup

**Scenario:**
TechXcel is shifting to a cloud-first approach to increase flexibility and reduce costs. You are
required to create a strategy for this migration.
Steps:

1. Analyse Cloud Costs:
- What are the costs of migrating to the cloud?
- Look at both the short-term (migration) and long-term (maintenance) expenses.

2. Plan for Mobility and Remote Access:
- How will employees work remotely?
- Consider application portability, data accessibility, and network readiness.

3. Evaluate Current Cloud Skills:
- Assess the team’s cloud management skills.
- Suggest training programs to bridge any gaps.

4. Ensure Scalability and Security:
- Plan for scalable cloud solutions that can grow with the company.
- Implement strong security measures for cloud data protection.

5. Cloud Storage and Backup:
- Ensure reliable cloud storage and backup processes.
- Plan for disaster recovery in case of failure.

### Deliverables:
* [ ] Detailed cloud adoption strategy

* [ ] Use Cisco Packet Tracer

- A detailed cloud adoption strategy that addresses cost, scalability, security, and
performance.
- Use Cisco Packet Tracer to visualize the network's connection to cloud resources.
